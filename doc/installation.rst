Installation
============

Via pip
-------

To install from PyPI:

.. code:: bash

  pip3 install github-fine-grained-token-client

Source code
-----------

The source repository can be found
`on GitLab <https://gitlab.com/smheidrich/github-fine-grained-token-client/>`_.
There is also a
`GitHub mirror <https://github.com/smheidrich/github-fine-grained-token-client>`_,
but I much prefer GitLab so all development happens there.
